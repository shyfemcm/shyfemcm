	This a a first pre-release version for the community model.

	All shyfem files now contain copyright notices. Source files
	also mention the GPL, script files and other minor files
	contain a short version of the copyright notice.

	All files now contain a statement like the following:

	Copyright (C) 1985-2018  Georg Umgiesser

	For many files this is not true, because I am not the only
	copyright holder. Therefore this line has to be customized.

	I would therefore ask everybody to go through the files and
	identify the files where they have contributed. Sometimes
	the revision log is a good point to start from.

	Please, in case you have contributed, add your name after mine,
	or add a new line resembling the line above with your name.
	If you are the main author, please put your name first, and if
	I have not contributed at all, please delete my name. We can
	have as many names as needed in the copyright notice.

	Here is a (not complete) list of all the persons I can think
	of that have contributed to the code and their contribution:

	Andrea: lagrangian, WRT, ERSEM
	Christian: sediments, lagrangian, tide, etc.
	Michol: lagrangian, connectivity
	Debora, William: non-hydrostatic
	Francesca: toxi
	Petras, Ali: aquabc, box model
	Cosimo, Donata: eutro
	Eric: OMP implementation
	CMCC: MPI implementation

	Sorry if I have forgotten someone and some topics. You will
	know better, please correct me.

	Please send me your input. Deadline is the end of February.
	This gives me then time to finalize the version that should
	become the starting point of the community model. Either send
	me the new files, or do a "pull request" from git-hub.

	This version will be slightly slower than the previous one.
	This is only because of the extra testing code inserted.
	In the future this testing code will be removed again.
