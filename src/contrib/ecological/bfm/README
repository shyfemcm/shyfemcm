this directory contains scripts and files for BFM
they are used to configure and compile the BFM model

this directory must be called fembfm and must be in the shyfem base directory
the shyfem base directory is the one that contains Rules.make and VERSION files

the file BFM0D needs customization depending on the BFM version
the default is to use the stable 5.1 version

==================================================================
Howto:
==================================================================

to integrate the BFM model the following has to be done:

to get started:

  1) download the BFM model from the official sources
     (https://www.bfm-community.eu)
  2) unpack in a directory of your choice
  3) goto to the shyfem base directory

in the Rules.make file:

  4) set "NETCDF = true" (BFM needs NETCDF)
  5) set "ECOLOGICAL = BFM" 
  6) set BFMDIR to the directory where BFM has been installed (point 2 above)

compile BFM:

  7) "make bfm_compile"

if everything is ok, SHYFEM can be compiled with BFM support:

  8) "make fem"

clean

  9) "make bfm_clean"
==================================================================

Please remember that steps 1-7 only have to be done once.
If the version of BFM does not change it is enough to only execute "make fem"
in order to compile SHYFEM with BFM support.
