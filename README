    SHYFEM - System of HydrodYnamic Finite Element Modules

    The finite element program SHYFEM is a program package that can
    be used to resolve the hydrodynamic equations in lagoons, seas,
    estuaries and lakes. The program uses finite elements for the
    resolution of the hydrodynamic equations. These finite elements,
    together with an effective semi-implicit time resolution algorithm,
    makes this program especially suitable for applications in areas
    with a complicated geometry and bathymetry.

    The program SHYFEM resolves the oceanographic primitive equations and
    can use both a two- and a three-dimensional formulation, depending on
    the needs of the user. Finite elements are well adapted to problems
    dealing with complex bathymetric situations and geometries. The
    finite element method has an advantage over other methods (e.g.,
    finite differences) because it allows more flexibility with its
    subdivision of the system in triangles varying in form and size. This
    flexibility can be used also in situations where it is not desired
    to have uniform resolution of the whole basin, but where a focus in
    resolution is needed only in some parts of the area.

    It is possible to simulate shallow water flats, i.e., tidal marshes
    that in a tidal cycle may be covered with water during high tide
    and then fall dry during ebb tide. This phenomenon is handled by
    the model in a mass conserving way.

You can compile everything from the SHYFEM directory by running the
command "make". Other commands are:

make help	gives help on available make targets
make fem	compiles everything
make doc	makes documentation in femdoc (manual)
make all	compiles (shyfem) and makes documents (doc)
make nuopc      compiles a shyfem nuopc-compliant library for coupled applications
make clean	deletes objetc and executable files in all subdirectories
make cleanall	as clean, but cleans also libraries
