HOWTO FEM FILES
===============================

All forcing files needed by SHYFEM are either simple time series files
or FEM files. The format of the FEM files can be found somewhere else
in the manual or in the file src/utils/generic/femfile.f90.

Here we describe how a FEM file can be produced starting from a NETCDF
file. This should be the normal procedure, since many data is nowadays
distributed by NETCDF (.nc) files.

The program to be used is called nc2fem. Is installed only if you have
enabled NETCDF support in the Rules.make file. How to do this can be
found in HOWTO-NETCDF.txt.  Please note that nc2fem has an online help
that can be seen with "nc2fem -h".

Running nc2fem on a NETCDF file will give you only basic information.
More information can be found running "nc2fem -varinfo file.nc" where
file.nc is your NETCDF file. In the example given here it will an output
such as:

    id natts  ndim   name / description
     1     4     1   time / time
     2     4     1   lon / longitude
     3     4     1   lat / latitude
     4     7     3   msl / air_pressure_at_mean_sea_level
     5     6     3   10v / 10 metre V wind component
     6     6     3   10u / 10 metre U wind component

If you do not want to use nc2fem to get this information, you can also
run "ncdump -h file.nc" which will give you a comprehensive list of all
the content in the file.

Since in this example we want to create a file for the wind forcing,
we will need the wind velocity and the atmospheric pressure. This can
be achieved by running "nc2fem -vars '10u,10v,msl' file.nc". It tells
nc2fem to extract the variables 10u, 10v, and msl from the file and
write them to the fem file "out.fem". If everything goes well you are
already finished. However, it is a good idea to rename the output file
"out.fem" to something more descriptive such as "wind.fem".

If the program complains that it cannot understand the meaning of the
some of the variables, you will have to specify the description on the
command line.  To do this first run "nc2fem -list" to find the acronyms
of the variable you have to specify, and then put them on the command
line. In the case above this would be "nc2fem -vars '10u,10v,msl' -descrp
'wind,wind,airp' file.nc". This tells the program that the first two
variables contain the wind, and the last one the atmospheric pressure.
You only have to specify the description of the variables that are not
recognized by nc2fem. So, if it complains about not knowing what msl is
you can specify the description as "-descrp ',,airp'".

You can do other things like limit the area of the domain that will be
extracted and written into out.fem or change the original values using
a factor or offset.

SHYFEM uses various files for forcing. For atmospheric forcing the
files to be given are wind, heat, and rain. The wind file has to contain
'wind,wind,airp' in that order, the heat file needs 'srad,airt,rhum,cc'
where the variables are respectively solar radiation, air temperature,
relative humidity, and cloud cover'. You can also use specific humidity by
specifying shum instead of rhum. Finally the rain file needs the variable
rain. This can be a bit tricky, because the value to be inserted is in
mm/day. If you are unsure about the conversion from the NETCDF file,
after creating rain.fem you can run it though femelab with the following
command line option: "femelab -checkrain rain.fem". This will give you an
idea of the entity of the rain you have produced. If this is different
from what you are expecting, you will have to revise the conversion
factor for the rain variable.

For the hydrodynamic variables you will probably need boundary and
initial conditions. Use zeta for water level, vel for velocities, and
salt and temp for salinity and temperature respectively. Again, please
check "nc2fem -list" for the right acronym to use for your variable.
Please remember that the last variables are 3D variables, so you will
have to specify them also in the vertical. If you only have 2D variables,
or the data does not cover the whole water column, SHYFEM will use the
last available data in the vertical and extend it down to the bottom. For
2D data this means that the whole water column will be homogeneous.
