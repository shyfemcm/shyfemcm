Howto install the model with git
================================

0) check your repository

	before you do anything else, please first read the file on what
	repository you should use: HOWTO_GIT_REPO

1) install git on your computer

	run "git --version"
	if you see no error, you already have git installed
	if not, please install git
	with debian, you can run (as superuser)
		apt update
		apt install git

2) get the latest version of the model

	The name of the repository below may change depending on
	your choice on what repository you have chosen to use.
	Please refer to point 0 above.

	You have two choices. The first is the preferred one.

	a) clone directly in your current directory
		git clone https://github.com/shyfemcm/shyfemcm.git myshyfem
		this will create a directory myshyfem in your current directory
		this directory contains the model code
		be sure not to have an existing myshyfem directory
			in your current directory
		you can give any name to the new shyfem directory
	
	b) download from Github
		goto https://github.com/shyfemcm/shyfemcm
		you will see a green button with "Code" written on it
		download the zip file
		do a "unzip -v" to see in what dir the model will be copied
		unzip in a convenient directory
		please remember that with this choice you do not need
		to install git on your computer. However, updating
		the model to a new version means that you will have
		to execute these steps over and over again

3) compile the model

	go into the directory that has been created and run
		make
	this should compile the model with standard flags
	you can always run "make help" to see other targets
	running "make check_software" will tell you what software 
		is missing for shyfem to be installed
	
4) make a symbolic link

	this is not necessary, but useful
	goto your home directory and run
		ln -s dir-where-shyfem-is-installed shyfem
	this will create a link to the new shyfem directory
	be sure you do not have a shyfem directory (or link) in your home

5) update the model

	this is needed when new functionality has been added to the model
	with these commands you can download the latest version easily

	updating only works if you have git installed on your computer
	and you have chosen option 2a above. In case you have chosen
	option 2b you will have to download the model again from scratch.

	goto the shyfem directory where the model is installed
		git fetch
		git pull
		make

	this will get the latest model version and compile it

	if you get an error with "git pull" you probably have changed
	something in the model code and the pull would overwrite
	your changes. Save your changes somewhere, then do
		git checkout file(s)
	where file(s) are the offending file(s)
		git pull
	and then compare the difference between your files and the new ones
