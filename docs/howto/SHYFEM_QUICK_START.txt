Quick Start Guide for SHYFEM
============================

SHYFEM is a modeling framework that allows you to perform hydrodynamic
simulations on a variety of problems.

In the following the steps to download, compile, and install SHYFEM are
shortly explained. For more explanation please refer to the manual.

Chose the repository
====================

The preferred way to download SHYFEM is through git from GitHub. First
chose a repository from the choices below. The first one is the official
repository, where all official versions of SHYFEM are hosted. This is a
conservative version of the model that might miss the latest updates. The
second one is the version from ISMAR with the latest enhancements and
bug fixes.

1) https://github.com/shyfemcm/shyfemcm

2) https://github.com/georgu/shyfemcm-ismar

In the following we will assume that you have chosen to use the ISMAR
version of SHYFEM.

Download the distribution
=========================

To download the distribution run the following command:

git clone https://github.com/georgu/shyfemcm-ismar.git myshyfem

This will download and copy the distribution to the directory
myshyfem. Please chose a suitable name for this directory. You can name
it any way you want.

Install the model
=================

First you will have to chose the branch to use in the distribution.
In most cases this will be the develop branch. In order to switch to
the desired branch, go to the directory you have just created (the
SHYFEM base directory) and run 'git checkout develop' for the develop
branch. Running 'git status' should give the confirmation that you are
on the desired branch.

After this run 'make install'. This will insert some small code into the
.bashrc file in order to set the PATH environmental variable. This gives
you the possibility to use the routines of SHYFEM without prefixing it
always with the absolute path of the commands.

In order that these changes are effective, after running the install
routine you must log off and then again log into your account.

All of the above steps have to be carried out only once. After these steps
have been carried out, you only need to routinely do the steps below here.

Compile the model
=================

In the simplest case, once you are in the base directory, just run 'make'
or 'make compile'. This should compile the model. If there some errors,
please check your installed software, because some libraries might be
missing. To do so run "make check_software" and see what software is
still needed. Install the missing software, and then recompile.

Update the model
================

If updates are available for the model (bug fixes, new features), it is
very easy to update the model. Just go to the base directory of SHYFEM
and run 'git pull'. Once the changes have been downloaded, just compile
the model again (make or make compile).

Run the model
=============

In order to run the model, you will need to have a numerical grid of
your domain (the .grd file), a parameter input file (typically a .str
file), and forcing data for the simulation, typically time series data
(.txt files) or spatially varying data (.fem files). The explanation of
how to prepare these files is out of the scope of this document. Please
refer to the manual for more information.

Report an error
===============

If an error occurres in any of the steps above or while running the model,
please report this. We will try to help you as much as we can. Please
be sure to exactly describe the error. It is important, before reporting
any error, to be sure to use the latest model version of the repository.
