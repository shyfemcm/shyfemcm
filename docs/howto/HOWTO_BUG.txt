HOWTO BUG
===============================

Please always use the latest version on GitHub.

-------------
Report a bug:
-------------

If you want to report an error or bug, please always send the error message
that the program is giving you together with the explanation of what
you were trying to do.

----------------
Reproduce a bug:
----------------

If you want me to reproduce to a bug, please do the following:

1) Try to simplify the simulation so that the bug still shows up. This means
that you should take away not necessary computations, boundary conditions, etc..

2) Once you have a simple simulation that still reproduces the bug, please 
try to create a STR file that uses as little simulation time as possible.

3) Run the following command:
	strparse.pl -collect=dir -reduce file.str
where dir is the directory where all file needed for the simulation will
be copied and file.str is the modified STR file. If the command strparse.pl
cannot be executed, please use the full file path shyfem_dir/bin/strparse.pl
where shyfem_dir is the directory where SHYFEM is installed.

4) If you cd to the new directory you should be able to run the simulation.
Please zip the directory, and send it to me. If too big, put it on a gdrive
and send me the link.
