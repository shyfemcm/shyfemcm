Howto choose the right repository for the model
===============================================

There is more than one repository for getting the code. Some of the
possibilities will be described below.

1) the official community repository

	https://github.com/shyfemcm/shyfemcm

	This is the official community model repository. Here all official
	updates and contributions eventually will end up. It might not
	contain the last developments, but it should be stable to be used
	for all purposes.

	In order to clone this repository, please run:

	git clone https://github.com/SHYFEM-model/shyfem.git

	or download from https://github.com/shyfemcm/shyfemcm

2) the old pre-community model repository

	https://github.com/SHYFEM-model/shyfem

	This contains the last version pre-community. It is now at
	version 7.5.85 and will not be evolving further

	Please do not use this distribution anymore.

	If for some reasons you still have to use this old version,
	please run:

	git clone https://github.com/SHYFEM-model/shyfem.git

	or download from https://github.com/SHYFEM-model/shyfem

3) the private ismar community repository

	https://github.com/georgu/shyfemcm-ismar

	Here all the development at the ISMAR institute is going on. The
	repository contains more branches. Depending on what you would
	like to do, once you have downloaded the model you should switch
	to the appropriate branch.

	main		this is the main branch and it should normally
			be the same as the main branch of the official
			repository in point 1 above.

	develop		here all the new developments of ISMAR are being
			kept. If you need a special feature that the
			official branch does not have, please look here.

	feature1	these is a feature branch. Here some new feature
			will be implemented. Once the feature is tested
			it will be ported to the develop branch.

	feature2	etc...

	In order to clone this repository, please run:

	git clone https://github.com/georgu/shyfemcm-ismar.git

	or download from https://github.com/georgu/shyfemcm-ismar

4) how to update and switch branches

	if you have used the command "git clone" in order to download
	and install the model, you can easily upgrade to a new version
	with this command:

	git pull

	if you get an error, please have a look at the HOWTO_GIT document
	to resolve the problem.

	To switch branches you do:

	git status		# this will tell you on what branch you are
	git checkout develop	# this will switch to the branch develop

	In order to switch to a different branch, once you have the model
	downloaded, run the command:

	git checkout another_branch
