HOWTO MPI
===============================

If MPI is already installed you can skip the part on how to install
gfortran and mpi. Please run "make test_mpi" from the shyfem base
directory to see if MPI is installed on your computer.

However, you must be sure that also the library METIS is installed. Please
refer to the instructions below.

===============================
HOWTO install MPI
===============================

This document describes the steps that have to be carried out in order
to run SHYFEM with MPI (domain decomposition). All examples have been
tested on a debian system (Ubuntu) with gfortran. Other linux systems
should be similar, as well as other compilers (Intel).

update the apt system (all commands with apt must be carried out as root): 
	apt update
	apt upgrade

If needed install the gfortran compiler: apt install gfortran. You can
check if gfortran is already installed running "gfortran --version".

If needed install the mpi libraries (openmpi): apt install openmpi. To
see if you already have the mpi routines and binaries installed run
"make test_mpi" from the base directory of shyfem.

===============================
HOWTO install METIS
===============================

Install the metis library to create automatic partition of the basin
(http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/metis/metis/overview). You can install
the system anywhere. Just remember the place, because you will have
to insert this information into the Rules.make file. It is, however,
recommended that you put all the add-on libraries in one place, such as
$HOME/lib. If you put metis in this directory shyfem will look automatically
for it and you do not have to specify the directory in Rules.make.

===============================
HOWTO compile and run shyfem in MPI mode
===============================

Change the file Rules.make
	Set the compiler
	PARALLEL_MPI = NODE 
	PARTS = METIS 
	METISDIR = $(HOME)/lib/metis or wherever the metis files 
	have been installed. If metis is in $(HOME)/lib/metis you
	do not have to set this variable.

if METIS is installed in $HOME/lib (you should have a directory metis
in this place) you can do everything above by just running

	make rules_mpi

recompile:

	make cleanall
	make fem

run shyfem:

	mpirun -np 4 path_to_shyfem/shyfem str-file.str

	test with a different number of domains (above 4 are used)
	if there are errors (there will be...) please let me know

===============================
present limitations of MPI mode
===============================

things that are not (yet) working:

	ktilt	(see marmenor)
	velocity nudging at open boundary (must be checked)

	sediments
	lagrangian
	closing routines

notes:
	maybe must exchange rqv in bnd_routines.f90
	must exchange twice in newcon.f -> check if really necessary
