HOWTO NETCDF
===============================

Normally netcdf should already be installed. To enable netcdf you
must set in Rules.make the following:

NETCDF = true

If the directory where netcdf is not installed you have to give it
explicitly in NETCDFDIR.

===============================

Reminder:

For nemunas server set:
NETCDFDIR = /opt/sw
